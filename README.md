# Activation Steering

👉 (Aug-2025) Added `pca_pairwise` method and set as default. Use `method="pca_pairwise"` to reproduce results closer to those reported in the paper. Colab demos (see below) are fixed accordingly, and they should work as expected.

👉 (Jul-2025) Bug fixed: PCA_centering (@Reason239)

👉 (Apr-2025) Conditional Activation Steering is a spotlight paper at ICLR 2025!

👉 (Nov-2024) A few Colab demos are added.

👉 (Sep-2024) Preprint released on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05907).

## Overview

This is a general-purpose activation steering library to (1) extract vectors and (2) steer model behavior. We release this library alongside our recent paper on [*Programming Refusal with Conditional Activation Steering*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05907) to provide an intuitive toolchain for activation steering efforts.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/activation-steering

pip install -e activation-steering
```

## Activation Steering
Activation steering is a technique for influencing the behavior of language models by modifying their internal activations during inference. This library provides tools for:

- Extracting steering vectors from contrastive examples
- Applying steering vectors to modify model behavior

This part is conceptually similar to [*Steering Language Models With Activation Engineering*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10248), but our code implementation could be different.

## Conditional Activation Steering
Conditional activation steering selectively applies or withholds activation steering based on the input context. Conditional activation steering extends the activation steering framework by introducing:

- Context-dependent control capabilities through condition vectors
- Logical composition of multiple condition vectors 

Refer to our [*paper*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05907) and [*documentation*](docs/quickstart.md) for detailed implementation and usage of activation steering and conditional activation steering.

## Documentation
Refer to /docs to understand this library. We recommend starting with Quick Start Tutorial as it covers most concepts that you need to get started with activation steering and conditional activation steering.
